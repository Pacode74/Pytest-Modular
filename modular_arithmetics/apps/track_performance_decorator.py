"""
Notes:
(1) We can configure the runtime limit to be something dynamic so we can define 
dynamically a baseline that's going to be the average of all the runs of all the developers.
And that's going to be our baseline and that's going to be the runtime limit for our test.
That's a very simple example, but that's a very common use case that we can do with 
performance testing.

(2) option to monitor and save into a database the performance results of the tests.
So lets say we have a few developers in our team and we want that for each developer 
that is running our test. We want to save the result of the test in the database.
I mean, the runtime result. So we can just add this functionality in our decorator 
because we implemented it ourselves.
 
Important: Instead of custom decorator `track_performance_decorator` 
that we wrote above we can use `pytest-timeout` build-in decorator.
